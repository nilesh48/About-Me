# About-Me
Why am I on GitHub?

# I have created GitHub account for following reasons:

1) I am starting to learn Python and from there I am thinking to take it all the way to Data Analysis and ML. I will be using GitHub to keep record of all the files and programmes I will be creating along the way.

2) I am very excited to connect with bright and amazing minds on this plateform!

3) Looking forward to learn and maybe help someone in their journey as well.
